								<h4>What is the Py Attire Logger</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/python_logo.png"  height="200" alt=""/></span>ATTiRe stands for attack tool timing and reporting. This is a machine-readable JSON formatted superset of useful attack simulation reporting data for content creation and enrichment in tracking tools like VECTR. It uses a structured log format to ease the creation of reporting detail and categorisation of red team activities. Several commercial and open-source red team operator tools use proprietary logging formats to record the results of adversary emulation and attack simulation. Normalization and translation of this log data can be challenging. At the moment these ATTiRe log files are being manually created. The goal for this Attire Logger project is to develop a program that will dramatically increase the efficiency at which this information is collected and then formatted into the correct layout before it is then subsequently uploaded to Vectr. Once the program has been tested extensively the goal is to roll it out to the cyber security professional community.</p>

								<h3>Description of Contents</h3>
                                <header>
									<h3>Versioning</h3>
									<p>This refers to ATTiRe v1.1. Subsequent foundational changes will lead to an increase in the ATTiRe version number.</p>
								</header>	
                                <header>
									<h3>Execution Data</h3>
									<p>Execution data in ATTiRe represents an execution event. For a portable executable or disposable script emulating a single procedure or a series of TTP's, this includes information related to the command run to trigger the execution and the active environment.</p>
                                    <p><b>execution-command:</b> <br>The command run to trigger the execution event.<br>

										<br> <b>execution-id:</b> <br>A unique identifier for the execution event, usually a random string meant to help dedupe attack logs.<br>
										<br> <b>execution-source:</b> <br>metadata describing the source of the execution. Typically used by the log consumer to name a campaign. examples: Invoke-atomicredteam, Cobalt Strike, Powershell Empire.<br>
										<br>  <b>execution-category:</b> <br> (optional) Metadata describing the category of all tests being run. This may be used by the log consumer to modify or provide additional detail to procedure names for long-term reference purposes like creating templates.<br>
										<br>  <b>name:</b> <br>Name for an execution category.<br>
										<br>   <b>abbreviation:</b> <br>Abbreviation for an execution category. May be used by log consumer to prefix generated procedure templates. Example: an abbreviation of "PRE" might create a procedure template of "PRE - Procedure1" for a procedure named "Procedure1".<br>
										<br> <b>target:</b><br> Target metadata for the execution event. A target may be something like information about a host where procedures are run or a web URL for a target application.<br>
                                        <br><b>host:</b> <br>Hostname where execution event was targeted.<br>
										<br> <b>ip:</b><br> IP address where execution event was targeted.<pr>
											<br> <b>path:</b> <br>(optional) path information on the execution target.<br>
											<br> <b>user:</b> <br>(optional) username of running user on execution target.<br>
											<br> <b>time-generated:</b> the time this logfile was generated.</p>
                               
								
											<p>Procedures</p>
											<p>Procedures represent a specific and reproducible instance of an attack that may be categorised by one or more MITRE ATT&CK Technique IDs. Many procedures may be categorized by a single MITRE Technique ID, and a procedure may be categorized by multiple MITRE Technique IDs. For testing clarity, it helps if a primary MITRE Technique ID is representing the action being performed.</p>
											<p>	procedure-name: a preferably unique name for the procedure being executed. Naming is more important than it seems. Noting proper specificity in the type of execution being performed makes it easier to prepare defences for the exact type of attack and gather intelligence on other similar attacks you may want to test.</p>
											<p>Bad name example: "WMI Exec"</p>
											<p>Good name example: "WMI Exec using WMIC.exe with os get /format flags"</p>
											<p>Coverage and testing against the badly named procedure could lead to a false sense of security for other types of WMI execution attacks.</p>
											<P>procedure-description: a longer-form description of the procedure being executed.
											•	procedure-id: unique identifier for a specific procedure. This helps to identify the procedure being run over time for historical tracking of results.
											o	type: the type of procedure ID, currently log consumers only support GUID.
											o	id: the procedure ID contents.
											•	mitre-technique-id: the primary mitre technique id for this procedure.
											•	order: (optional) the order this procedure was run in the list of procedures.
											•	steps: a list of steps executed within the described procedure.
											•	command: the command for the current step. Example: maybe a command-line execution like cmd.exe /c ipconfig.
											•	executor: a string representing the executor for the current step. If intended to be reproducible, should match expected enumerated values by consuming the tool.
											•	order: An integer value to inform the renumbering of this command step.
											•	time-start: ISO-8601 timestamp in UTC representing the start time of the command. Example: "2021-10-27T02:02:23.000Z".
											•	time-stop: ISO-8601 timestamp in UTC representing the stop time of the command. Example: "2021-10-27T02:02:25.000Z".
											•	output: Output entries from the current command.
											•	content: String content output from the current command, may include encoded data like base64 depending on the consuming application.
											•	level: The level of logging content - typically STDERR / STDOUT for console, could be INFO, ERROR, WARN for applications.
											•	type: The type of command step output. Example: "console".
